# RoboStack
Welcome to RoboStack - a bundling of the Robot Operating System (ROS) by Open Robotics for Linux, Mac and Windows using the Conda package manager. We provide ROS packages for ROS1 Noetic, ROS2 Foxy and ROS2 Galactic (experimental), as well as a variety of ROS related plugins for Jupyter notebooks.

If you use RoboStack in an academic article, please cite the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12910):

## Why RoboStack?
- ROS on *any* platform: Linux (any distribution, new and old), MacOS and Windows
- Easy installation of ROS side-by-side with PyTorch, Tensorflow & many more (very recent) machine learning and computer vision algorithms in a Conda environment
- No root access required - install ROS on shared workstations & high-performance computers
- Reproducible environments and reproducible robotics research
- RViz-like visualizations in the browser *without* a ROS installation
- Control your robot in Jupyter notebooks & ROS integration with Jupyterlab
- Easy package creation - creating a Conda package is much easier than creating Debian packages
- Cross-platform CI for ROS packages
- ...

Here you can see RViz on Linux Fedora, MacOS and Windows:
